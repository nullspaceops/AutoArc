This is a simple updater for ArcDPS, an unofficial Guild Wars 2 plugin.

This version of the updater downloads/updates:
- The main module (DPS Meter)
- The buildtemplates module (Templates)
- The mechanics module (Mechanics Log & Chart)
- The extra module (Hide UI Stuff)

You access them ingame - check https://www.deltaconnected.com/arcdps/ for more info.

Drop this file in your GW2 folder and you can simply update all modules at once, create a shortcut for usage.

When you start it, it will kill off any instances of Gw2, so be careful.

Feel free to compile yourself, if you don't trust me for any reason.

PS: Don't worry about Windows Smartscreen opinion about that file. You can always check on Virustotal.
